/// StableSwap AMM — a two-token liquidity pool optimized for stablecoin pairs.
///
/// ## Background
///
/// Constant-product AMMs (Uniswap-style x·y=k) have significant price impact
/// even for modest trades. For assets that should trade at nearly equal value
/// (USDC/USDT, USDh/USDT, etc.) the Curve-style hybrid invariant:
///
///   4·A·(x + y) + D  =  4·A·D + D³/(4·x·y)
///
/// gives dramatically lower slippage while still self-balancing when the peg
/// breaks. The amplification parameter A controls the trade-off:
///
///   - High A (100-2000): very stable, nearly flat curve near peg
///   - Low A (1-10): close to constant-product, handles de-peg better
